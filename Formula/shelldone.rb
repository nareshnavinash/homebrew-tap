    <<~EOS
      Add to your shell config (~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc):

        eval "$(shelldone init zsh)"   # for zsh
        eval "$(shelldone init bash)"  # for bash

      Or run automatic setup:

        shelldone setup

      Optional: install AI CLI notification hooks:

        shelldone setup ai-hooks
        shelldone setup claude-hook
    EOS
  end

  test do
    assert_match "shelldone", shell_output("#{bin}/shelldone version")
  end
end
